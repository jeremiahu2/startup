# Your startup name here

[My Notes](notes.md)

This application can be used as polling or census program. Simply provide a link to it, and users can answer the provided questions.


> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

> [!NOTE]
>  If you are not familiar with Markdown then you should review the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) before continuing.

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

> [!NOTE]
>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

If you ever need to send out a poll or take a census of a small group, this application can help you with that. Users simply sign in to the application and answer the questions. The applications will save the answers and who answered what and create a simple report. You can then review and use that report.

### Design

This application will have a login screen where users will enter their username, and multiple question pages where they will answer various questions.


### Key features

- Saves and reports on who filled out the forms
- Reports the answers to questions in the forms
- Creates a chart to display the total users and answers to questions

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses two HTML pages. One for logging in and one for answering questions
- **CSS** - Good application style, whitespace, and contrast in the forms and login
- **React** - Will provide login, display, and apply users answers
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
  - logging in
  - retrieving question
  - submitting answers
- **DB/Login** - Store users, questions, and answers in database. Usernames securely stored in database. Can't vote without username
- **WebSocket** - As each user answers, their answers are broadcast to the report
